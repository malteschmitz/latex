% Use this file to define some macros you need in your thesis. A macro is a short command that inserts some mathematical symbols or texts you do not want to retype each time you need some. I recommend to use as many macros as possible, because you are able to change them later. For example if you use the same macro each time you need to give the formal semantics of an expression you can easily change the appearance of these brackets by updating the macro later on.

% Set of natural numbers
\newcommand{\N}{\mathbb{N}}

% The default epsilon does not look very nice
\let\epsilon\varepsilon

% If you need to use mathematical expressins like an epsilon in the section titles of your thesis you will end up with warnings that these special symbols cannot be included in the PDF favorites. The following macro uses the mathematical symbol during the text of the thesis and the string "Epsilon" in the PDF favorites.
\newcommand{\pdfepsilon}{\texorpdfstring{$\epsilon$}{Epsilon}}
